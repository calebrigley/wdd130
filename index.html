            <p>Utah is a state in the western United States. It is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology, and research, and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital and largest city, is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). I sure like it.</p>
